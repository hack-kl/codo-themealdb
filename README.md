## Inspiration

The Pack adds power extensions to Coda docs.  The coding experience is very pleasant and easy.  

## What it does

This is an integration with TheMealDB API with Coda.  The current version uses the test API key.  Hence there is some functionalities not implemented.

## How we built it

I use the Coda lib and node.js and follow the Coda documentation as a guide.  The CLI is simple to use.

## Challenges we ran into

I did not run into any major challenges.  The documentation, which is clear and complete, helps a lot and makes the integration very easy. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I managed to complete one Pack and going to make another pack for this hackathon.

## What we learned

We learned how to make a Pack extension in a short period of time.

## What's next for TheMealDB Coda Pack

I plan to use a live API key and/or integrate with other recipe providers' API.
